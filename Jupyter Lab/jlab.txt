In JupyterLab, headings are created using Markdown syntax. The number of `#` symbols at the beginning of a line indicates the level of the heading. For example:
- `#` creates a top-level heading.
- `##` creates a second-level heading.
- `###` creates a third-level heading.

This allows for organizing content into sections and subsections, making it easier to read and navigate.

(--- for drawing a horizontal line)

(To add a cell above...click A,Press B for adding a cell below)

(Press M for markdown,Press Y for code)

(Esc+(k or j)to toggle between codes(for editing purpose))

(press d twice to delete)

(though in vs code...code can be executed from anywhere...but it is a good practice to write all the codes line by line...it can give error in the web based jupyter lab)


In addition to headings, JupyterLab supports other Markdown features such as:

- **Bold text**: Use `**` or `__` to enclose the text.
- *Italic text*: Use `*` or `_` to enclose the text.
- `Inline code`: Use backticks `` ` `` to enclose the code.
- Blockquotes: Start the line with `>`.
- Lists: Use `-` or `*` for unordered lists, and numbers for ordered lists.
- Links: Use `[link text](URL)` to create a hyperlink.
- Images: Use `![alt text](URL)` to embed an image.

These features help in creating well-formatted and visually appealing documents.
